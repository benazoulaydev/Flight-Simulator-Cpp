Created by [KfirYehuda](https://github.com/kfiryehuda) and

## Installation
Please read flightgear [installations](https://www.flightgear.org/download/main-program/) carefully! It explicitly says how to download on which OS and where the files exist once you download onto your machine.
**newest mac users with Catalina, you may have problems with the simulator. I suggest finding a parter without the newest version of Mac OS. Those in dualboot on ubuntu, you can install flightgear from the app store (software center) that ubuntu has.


- Install [FlightGear](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flightgear/files/) to install Flight Simulator.

- Download the [code](https://github.com/benazoulaydev/Flight-Simulator-Cpp/archive/master.zip) from our repo.

- In the FlightGear Game Folder : game/flightgear/Protocol
add the file generic_small.xml. The file is in the asset directory (in the code you download from github). 
Note: You may need to change the permissions for copying this file to the folder. In my computer the folder is at : '/usr/share/games/flightgear/Protocol' 

- Open the FlightGear app, go to settings and to Additional Settings write : 
--generic=socket,out,10,127.0.0.1,5400,tcp,generic_small   
--telnet=socket,in,10,127.0.0.1,5402,tcp

- Copy fly.txt From the Assets folder to the same folder as the main.cpp.

## Usage
You can change the content inside fly.txt according to how you want the plane acts.
You can read the FlightSimulator - Clarifications.pdf and the hebrew explanation.pdf for a better understanding.
```cpp
g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp 
-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread 

./a.out fly.txt
```
- In Flight Gear app press Fly Button.
